Vert.x Demo Module
============

This is the Vert.x demo's side.

NOTE
============
This module is running under version 1.0.0-beta3-SNAPSHOT for module io.vertx~lang-nashorn.
Until Leonardo's patch is not merged, we need it to use JavaScript debugging.
To test the debug in the NetBeans IDE, click with the mouse right button, select Custom and than 'Debug module'.
It will automatically run the module in debug mode.
